# Loyalty App

This application demonstrates how to leverage Custom Metdata Types to dynamically display and edit data from a webservice. The example is a loyalty application. All loyalty user profile and points are stored in an external system (heroku app with nodejs, express, and mongodb).  Two Lightning components are used to display a list of loyalty members and a member's details. The Member Custom Metdata Type stores, field label, field name on heroku app and which fields to be displayed and editable by the user.  

## Additional Notes
